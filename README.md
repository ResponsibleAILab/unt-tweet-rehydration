# UNT Tweet Rehydration

In compliance with Twitter’s terms of service, when exporting tweets from our [Interactive Web Query System](https://sigspatial.yunhefeng.me/
), you will receive only the ID of the tweet. To fetch full details of tweets using these IDs, our tool offers a ‘rehydration’ solution.

This process does add a step to your process when using our dataset, but it means that both our dataset, UNT Geotweet Archive, and our clients are compliant with the required terms.
